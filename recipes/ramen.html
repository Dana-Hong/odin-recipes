            <li>Freshly steamed white rice </li>
            <li>1 leek, julienned </li>
        </ul>
        Tare Sauce
        <>
            <li>1 1/2 cup light soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar (you can also use 1 cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>instead of half dark brown half white)</li> 
            <li>1 cup sake</li>
            <li>1 cup mirin</li>1 cup water
            <li>1 cup water</li> 
            <li>1 leek</li>
            <li>1/2 onion</li>
            <li>1 ginger, quartered</li>
            <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        Tare Sauce
        <ol>
            <li>Optional, but recommended: char the leeks and onion until blackened and blistered. This process will give the sauce smokiness and immense depth of flavor. </li>
            <li>Put the charred leeks and onion in a large saucepan. Add the rest of the sauce ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat on high heat until the sauce comes to a simmer. Drop the heat to a medium-low and simmer for 30 minutes or until the garlic has fully softened and let out its flavor.</li>
            <li>Strain the sauce. </li>
        </ol>
        Cha Shu
        <ol>
            <li>Roll your pork belly into a tight roll</li>
            <li>Using a butcher's twine, tighten the end of the pork roll to keep it taut. Repeat the process until the pork is in a tight roll. If you're unsure about this process, there are many youtube tutorials online. The pork belly needs to be super tight to stay in the rolled shape later when slicing. </li>
            <li>Sear the pork on all sides. This process helps crisp up the skin and also gives it a nice char.</li>
            <li>After the pork is golden brown, add it to a large pot with the rest of the tare sauce and 1 cup of water. </li>
            <li>Simmer the pork in the sauce on medium-low. Cook for 90 minutes, rotating every 15 minutes. I opted to put parchment paper with holes to regulate the amount of sauce evaporation. This technique is called cartouche! You can also put the lid on but slightly ajar. Alternatively, you can cook it in the oven at 325F for 2 hours or until the internal temperature reaches 145F. It's okay if the center is slightly pink! We will be blow-torching or pan-searing before serving. </li>
            <li>After the pork has finished cooking, let it rest in room temperature for 30 minutes. Make sure to reserve enough tare sauce to marinate the eggs in! Then, transfer the pork to a plastic bag with the remaining sauce. </li>
            <li>Chill overnight in fridge. </li>
            <li>Once the pork has chilled, it should be firm and easy to cut. Remove the twine, and cut the cha shu into thin slices. </li>
            <li>Char the pork with blow torch or lightly pan fry with sauce.</li>
            <li>For assembly, drizzle 2-3 tbsp of the tare sauce over freshly steamed white rice. Place a mound of julienned leeks in the center-- this will help stabilize the cha shu. Plate six slices of cha shu on top of the rice. Drizzle more tare sauce on the cha shu. Enjoy! </li>
        </ol>
        Eggs
        <ol>
            <li>Put the eggs in a medium-sized pot and cover with water until the half-way mark. </li>
            <li>Heat on high until the water comes to a low simmer. Drop the heat to a low simmer and set a timer for 6 minutes. </li>
            <li>Take the eggs out of the water and in an ice-bath to stop them from cooking further. </li>
            <li>Take the eggshells off and add the tare sauce reserved from the pork. Marinate for 3 hours or overnight!</li>
        </ol>
